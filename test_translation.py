This is considered an early stage (IA) cancer. Based on guidelines, additional treatment may be recommended to reduce the risk of recurrence, and your care team will discuss options such as radiation therapy. We will work together to plan the next steps for your care.",

You have had surgery to remove the uterus and ovaries with no remaining cancer. Given the low stage, we will monitor you closely and may recommend a small internal vaginal radiation treatment to lower the chance of recurrence. Follow-up visits and imaging will be scheduled regularly.",

This is classified as stage IIIA. The recommended treatment includes chemotherapy and may include focused radiation to the pelvis or vaginal area. We will guide you through each step and provide support throughout your treatment.",

Your uterus, ovaries, and fallopian tubes were removed, and no cancer was found in the ovaries or omentum. To lower the chance of recurrence, you will receive carboplatin and paclitaxel chemotherapy combined with external beam pelvic radiation and a vaginal brachytherapy boost.

To lower the chance of return, we recommend targeted radiation to your pelvis and vagina and a course of chemotherapy. This combined approach is standard for your stage of disease and is aimed at improving long-term outcomes.",
